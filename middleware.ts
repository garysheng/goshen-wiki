// Vercel Routing Middleware (platform-level, runs before the cache).
// Two layers, in a load-bearing order:
//   1. Bot-block: known LLM training and AI-search crawlers get a hard 403 by
//      User-Agent. Compliant crawlers that ignore robots.txt still stop here.
//   2. One-page shares: /s/<sig>/<route> and /s/mint (src/share/handleShare.ts).
//      DORMANT on this open template, since a share address only redirects to a
//      page anyone can already read. A GATED wiki wires the same call in with its
//      own gate's verdict, and then the address serves the chrome-less mirror the
//      share-view plugin builds, to a reader who has no password and needs none.
// No auth or password logic here; a gated wiki adds its gate BELOW the share layer.

// Minimal ambient declaration: this repo has no @types/node, but the Vercel
// edge runtime provides process.env at runtime. Keeps the file type-clean.
declare const process: { env: Record<string, string | undefined> };

// Unfurl scrapers ALWAYS pass, and this is evaluated FIRST, before any block
// or gate below. These are the bots that build link-preview cards in iMessage,
// Slack, X, WhatsApp, Discord, LinkedIn, etc. A wiki that blocks or gates them
// unfurls as a blank card everywhere a link is pasted, and nothing in the page
// source explains why. This allowlist exists so no future edit to the blocked
// pattern (Facebot, Applebot variants) can break previews by accident.
//
// GATED WIKIS: keep this same early return ahead of the password check, and
// support prefilled links (`?key=<password>` -> set cookie, 303 to the clean
// URL) so a shared link lands the reader ON the page while still unfurling
// beautifully. Live copies: supersuit-wiki/middleware.ts (password only),
// agenticbusiness-wiki/middleware.ts (password + Google identity).
